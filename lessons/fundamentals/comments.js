/* 
In Javascript comments are used for:
- Explaining a line code
- Adding readability of the code in plain english
- Exclude some lines of code from being executed


Note: Comments may feel unnecessary, but it will help with the developers for further understanding. It will also help prevent confusion when going back to the application after a break. It can also be searchable so if you are looking for a certain code section you can leave comment for quick reference.
